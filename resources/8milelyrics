This guy raps like
his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon,
The generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here,
Except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay,
You look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
How can six dicks be pussies
Talkin' 'bout shit's creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek
With paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink
You're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit,
This is a turtle race
He can't get with me,
Spitting this shit wickedly
Lickety shot suspicious
Spickety split lickety
So I'ma turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskal,
Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin',
He's paranoid!
Someone get his ass another steroid!
"Blahbity bloo blah blah
Blahbity bloo blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said,
"hipidy hooblah!"
Is that a tank top, or a new bra?
Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job!
Didn't you listen to the last round,
Meat head?
Pay attention, you're sayin'
The same shit that he said!
Matter fact, dog, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit,
Make it suspenseful,
And don't come back until something dope hits you
Fuck it!
You can take the mic home with you!
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you,
Tank top screamin',
"Lotto, I don't fit you!"
You see how far those white jokes get you
Boy's like
"How Vanilla Ice gonna diss you?"
My motto: Fuck Lotto!
I get the 7 digits
from your mother for a dollar tomorrow!
Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking
hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking
hands up! Look, look...
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man
Did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything
He's 'bout to say against me
I am white
I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend
Named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped
By all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming,
"Fuck the Free World!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook,
That's a private school
What's the matter, dawg?
You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster?
His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle,
He's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as
Halfway crooks
He's scared to death,
He's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook;
Fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock,
Fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody!
Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash,
 I say it proudly
And fuck this battle,
I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Tell these people something
They don't know about me
